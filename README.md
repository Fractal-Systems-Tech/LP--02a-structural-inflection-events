# LP‑02a: Structural Inflection Events

This logic paper introduces Structural Inflection Event SIE‑6: **Substrate Collapse via Overgrowth**, as a framing for TSMLA’s™ immunity to AI infrastructure debt and unsustainable stochastic models.

### Version  
**v2.1 – December 1, 2025**

---

### Highlights

- Includes **OpenAI / Stargate** case study  
- Defines **Audit Artifacts A12–A14**
- Introduces **Replay Equivalence** and **RSF™** logic references

---

### Why It Matters

This paper articulates a class of system failure that emerges from unchecked expansion atop stochastic substrates. TSMLA™ is presented as structurally immune due to its resonance-bounded logic, mirror-state enforcement, and non‑recursive substrate behaviors.

LP‑02a does not expose internal logic thresholds, classifiers, or core system math. It is safe for public distribution and academic review.

## Appendix A — Artifact Templates (A1–A14)

Note: These artifacts are **future-state audit outputs**. They are not runtime logs. They define the system’s audit pathways post‑prototype and are listed here for pre‑build clarity only.

## Artifact Templates (A1–A14)

These artifact specifications correspond to the Conformance Checklist in LP‑02a §9 and are operational until formal LPs (06, 07, 10, 14, 17) are published.
